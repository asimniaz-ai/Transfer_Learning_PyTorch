# Transfer_Learning_PyTorch

Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is re-purposed on a second, related task. This is done by taking advantage of the fact that the model has already learned useful features from the first task, which can then be fine-tuned or used as is to improve performance on the second task. This can be useful in cases where there is limited data available for the second task or when the second task is related to the first task and can benefit from the knowledge learned by the first model.

Hymenoptera_data is a commonly used dataset in computer vision and machine learning for classification. It is a dataset of images of two species of hymenoptera insects: ants and bees. The dataset contains a total of 120 images, with 80 images of ants and 40 images of bees. The images are of different sizes and have been resized to 256x256 pixels. The dataset is often used as a benchmark for image classification tasks and is available in PyTorch's torchvision library.
